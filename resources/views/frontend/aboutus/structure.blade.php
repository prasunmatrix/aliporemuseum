        <p>Every district (except north and south 24 pgns) has a Central Co-operative Bank. The name of the bank in our district is Raiganj Central Co-operative Bank as the Head Office of the bank is located at Ukilpara, Raiganj. RCCB has 16 branches, 13 branches located in Uttar Dinajpur and 3 in DakshinDinajpur. We operate under the aegis of The West Bengal State Co-operative Bank, a scheduled bank like any other nationalised bank. Presently we cater to the financial needs of 235 active societies mainly PACS, ECCS, Labour Co-operative etc. All these societies are registered with Co-operation Directorate and are members of our bank. We provide financial assistance to all these societies through various loans and other schemes. Some of the societies also have a certain portion of their deposit portfolio with us. The PACS and other societies are not our branches.
